# androidappGeolocation is a android application, which shows a timelapse of events on a heatmap. The application converts ip data to corresponding latitude and longiitude. The sample textfile can be downloaded. The user can also provide link to his her own files(format should be same as sample given). The file data is uploaded to Nodejs server in json format for decoding. Decoding the data takes about 15-20 mins depending the volume on the data. User patience is highly requested. Later on the user can view the time lapse using the play button.
