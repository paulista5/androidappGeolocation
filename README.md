# androidappGeolocation is a android application, which shows a timelapse of events on a heatmap. The application converts ip data to corresponding latitude and longiitude. The sample textfile can be downloaded. The user can also provide link to his her own files(format should be same as sample given). The file data is uploaded to Nodejs server in json format for decoding.  Later on the user can view the time lapse using the play button or use the seebar to view the heat at a particular time!!!.
